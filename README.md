driving innovation in the financial industry (Lee & Shin, 2017)"

`Overview:` 

Traditional domains within the financial industry continue to be disrupted and forced to evolve in new ways due to the introduction and capablilites of new fintech technology and companies entering the industry. One Canadian Fintech company in particular that has found success in disrupting traditonal financial products and services, and that this study will be focused on, is Quandl Inc. 

Quandl Inc. offers a data search engine platform with the purpose of providing quick access to alternative and financial data (Pitchbook, 2023). The company was incorporated in 2011, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The founders of Quandl are Abraham Thomas & Tammer Kamel. 

The idea and innovation behind this company was driven by two main beliefs held by the founders about future direction of the Finanical industry: 

1. Data is one of the most important resources of the 21st century (Quandl, 2023). 

2. The use of data and more specifically alternative data, will become the primary driver of active investment performance over the next decade (Quandl, 2023).

The funding for Quandl has been raised over 4 seperate rounds so far inclduing: Seed Round, Series A, Series B, and the latest round of funding from a Venture Series (Crunchbase, 2023). Quandl has raised a total amount of CA$20.4M in funding so far (Crunchbase, 2023). Two of the most recent investors in the company are growX ventures and August Capital. 

`Business Activities:`

Fintech development, in most cases, serves the purpose of solving an exsisting financial problem and/or increasing efficiencies relating to methods used in traditional financial domains. Quandl believes the ability to make alpha (profit) producing investment decisions is rooted in quaility and unique data; finding this data for yourself can be difficult and prolonged in most cases. Quandl aims to solve this financial problem by uncovering valuable data that is difficult to find, shaping it and sharing it with their clients. Technological developments in areas of infrastructure, big data and data analytics have allowed fintech startups to disintermediate traditional financial firms with unique, niche, and personalized services (Lee & Shin, 2017). At Quandl the belief is that there are new and better ways to understand complex information that creates markets and market movement. The goal is to utlizie their technology to find opportunities in places people normally would not think to look, and then insipre thier customers to make new discoveries and incorprate them into their trading strategies (Quandl, 2023). 

Quandl delivers financial, economic and alternative data to over 400,000 people worldwide. Quandls customers include, but are not limited to, the worlds top: 

   - *Hedge Funds*
   - *Asset Managers*
   - *Investment Banks*

Quandl offers both free and paid for data packages. Alternative data packages for specific use come with a fee.
