driving innovation in the financial industry (Lee & Shin, 2017)"

`Overview:` 

Traditional domains within the financial industry continue to be disrupted and forced to evolve in new ways due to the introduction and capablilites of new fintech technology and companies entering the industry. One Canadian Fintech company in particular that has found success in disrupting traditonal financial products and services, and that this study will be focused on, is Quandl Inc. 

Quandl Inc. offers a data search engine platform with the purpose of providing quick access to alternative and financial data (Pitchbook, 2023). The company was incorporated in 2011, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The founders of Quandl are Abraham Thomas & Tammer Kamel. 

The idea and innovation behind this company was driven by two main beliefs held by the founders about future direction of the Finanical industry: 

1. Data is one of the most important resources of the 21st century (Quandl, 2023). 

2. The use of data and more specifically alternative data, will become the primary driver of active investment performance over the next decade (Quandl, 2023).

The funding for Quandl has been raised over 4 seperate rounds so far inclduing: Seed Round, Series A, Series B, and the latest round of funding from a Venture Series (Crunchbase, 2023). Quandl has raised a total amount of CA$20.4M in funding so far (Crunchbase, 2023). Two of the most recent investors in the company are growX ventures and August Capital.
